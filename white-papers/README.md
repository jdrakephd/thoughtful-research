# White Papers

This directory contains white papers produced by Thoughtful Research.

## Organization

Each white paper should have its own subdirectory with a descriptive name. For example:

```
white-papers/
├── market-analysis-saas-2026/
├── ai-adoption-trends/
└── startup-funding-insights/
```

## Naming Convention

- Use lowercase letters
- Separate words with hyphens (-)
- Use descriptive names that clearly indicate the topic
- Include the year if relevant

## Structure

Each white paper subdirectory should typically contain:

- `README.md` - Overview and summary of the white paper
- Source documents (e.g., `.docx`, `.pdf`)
- Supporting data files
- Analysis scripts or notebooks
- Figures and visualizations
- References and citations
